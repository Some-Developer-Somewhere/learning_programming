# Learning Programming

For now, tih repo just contains som simple notes that I can share for creating an overview of how to get into programming.

The main language will be Python, as my opinion is that that language is the best for getting into the basics of programming as it is easy to start with, and ypou can do almost anything with it.

## Setting up the coding environment (python and an editor)

### Installing python

- Download the latest Python 3 version: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Make sure to select the option to "add to path" (on windows) and then restart machine after installing python.
